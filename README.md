Udacity Memory Game thired Project Of Front-End Developer Nanodegree.


## How It Works?

The game will test the player memory by shuffling and thin showing the 16 pairs
of symbols that shown in the cards at the first seconds, after that they will be hidden,
and here the challenge began!!.
The player will try to match all the cards with their pairs.

In detail:
* The player will open the first card.
* Then opens the second card, trying to remember the symbols and matching them with their pairs.
* If the 2 cards are the same, the color of the cards will change and they will be opened.
* If the cards does not match, they will be closed after one sec.

#### According to the number of moves, the stars will be shown:
*  :star::star::star: moves between 0 and 20.
* :star::star: moves between 20 and 30.
* :star: 30 or more.

After matching all of the cards, "congratulation" alert will appear contains
the time and moves and the number of stars as a score.
